# README Generator using node.js and inquirer

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
## Description
This application utilises the inquirer package in node.js to create command lines that will generate a readme.md file based on the responses. The license badges are also dynamically changed depending on the selection chosen in the prompts provided. In future I'd add an option to remove the content titles if there is none required.

## Table of Contents

## Installation 
Please run the following command line to install the neccesary packages

## Usage
How to use this code

After installing the necessary packages, run node index.js in your terminal of where index.js is located. Then answer the questions in the terminal when prompted for the contents. Once finished, a readme will be generated under the name 'README.md'. A badge for the license will be populated dynamically depending on your choice for license.
